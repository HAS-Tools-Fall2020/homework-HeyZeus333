    "First I created a weekly boxplot distribution containing all data for those weeks(Figure 1), this seemed too broad to me so I analysed the yearly changes in a new data frame (yearly) from june - august 21st  because the summer is the part most affecting this drought. I grouped these by flow and described by year (code: x=yearly.groupby('year')['flow'].describe()). I found while looking at the table that I could use 2011-2019 but would rather not use data in 2017 and 2019 because they either had too high of a mean or a great standard deviation. I plotted weekly data using these years in a box plot (Figure 2) and saw that the data looks more uniform and compact at a lower flow value. The means of all these years was much too high because we are in a drought so I decided to find a mean quantile # that matched the mean 2020 flow for this period (june - august 21st). I found x3=yearly.groupby('year')['flow'].quantile(0.11).mean() to be extremely close to the mean of 47 cfs. so applied this to every week in the time period and got a nice looking plot that see Figure 3 that matches initially the flows of 40-60 cfs that we saw leading up to the first week of the semester in 2020.\n",

    "As, for my two-week forcast I utilized the same technique but I had a month extra data so I shifted my data to match that and ommitted June and instead used the period from (august - september 26th). This one was tricky though because no quantile number matched the mean 2020 flow so I useed the lowest I could 0 and found the percent error of quantile 0 and the mean 2020 flow. I found that 1- decimal-percent error to be ~ 0.915 and multiplied this by my 1 week and 2 week quantiles to get 65.57 & 63.93 respectively for my week 1 and 2 forecasts.\n",

    "1. Provide a summary of the data frames properties.\n",
    "What are the column names?\n",
    "first is 'flow', 'year', 'month', 'day' and 'datetime' we also have 'agency_cd', 'site_no', and 'code' which were not utilised.\n",
    "What is its index?\n",
    "index is the position that python recognizes as starting at 0, each index location is specified as a reading on a specific date. \n",
