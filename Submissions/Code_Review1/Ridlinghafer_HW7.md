The python book is pretty straight forward just make sure to read comments as you go if you have trouble understanding how things were done.
Note: make sure that 
filename = 'streamflow_week6.txt'
filepath = os.path.join('../../data', filename)
is changed to where you keep it and to 'streamflow_week7.txt' so you get this assignments predictions not lastweeks.
