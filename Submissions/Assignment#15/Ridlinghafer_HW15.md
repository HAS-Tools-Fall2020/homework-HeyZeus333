#Questions



1. What resources did you request on Ocelote? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?

I requested 1 node, 1 core, and 6gb of memory total. The queue was almost instant maybe like 2-3 seconds. It only took 5 seconds to run my entire script.

2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Ocelote?

I had trouble with the windows not uploading the file properly so converting it to unix format was the only issue that I had.

3. Where else did you run your job? How did the setup compare to your run on Ocelote?

I ran my script on Google Collab the setup was almost exactly how you would run a jupyter notebook on your own computer. Although, it seemed a bit faster than my pc when running cells. This was much less complicated and was easy to set-up and use I had no issues with this setup.

4. What questions do you still have after doing this?

I am curious how fast this could run massive for loops, or our final project in modflow last semester cause that took like 5-10 minutes for one cell I remember. I am also curious to how changing to multicore usage would increase speeds.
