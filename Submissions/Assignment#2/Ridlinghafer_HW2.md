I imported the data from 1989 until the present and imported this data into a data frame using the starter code so I could manipulate and plot the data. I then changed the slicing period to be consistant to contain the periods of September to early December. I then wanted to be able to look at the data each year so I made an integer of n*365 that I added to the x coordinates so that it increased by a year by changing the value of n. There were two common trends through out the years, (1) the period had low flow at the begining and gradually increased until December, and (2) there were large flow spikes at the begening of the period that dwarfed the flow changes so the rest looked flat (no trend). I decided the first type was a more accurate representation of what to expect the year 2017 seemed to best fit this trend as it mostly resmbeled a curve. For this week I thought since the weather is cooling off and it's been about 40-60 cfs I think it will be ~65 and the week after ~60.
