Initially I found the average cfs of the entire data column to be ~350 upon closer inspection I found each week to have visually less than that so I founnd the Average of late Summer (September) 179 cfs and Fall/ early winter (rest of the semester) 191 cfs and used this instead for my forcast. For next week I thought well it is was rainy before it started and temperature is lower than normal so I figured it would be a little higher than normal leading to my assumption of 185 cfs. I thought the next week may be a little higher as well so I picked 180. For the rest of the weeks I just used the average of there respective periods of the year because I do not know when storms will occur and the temperature during the upcoming weeks and know that flow rate is dependent on these.

## Grade
3/3 - Great job! I like your logic.
